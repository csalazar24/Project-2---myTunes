# Project-2---myTunes

## Christopher Salazar & Gavin McCulley

1. Our Program is a WPF application that allows a user to organize and play songs.  Audio files can be added to and removed 
from the app and organized into playlists.  Music and playlist data are stored in an XML file. 
2. We met all the requirements of the Procrastination Penalty on time.
